# Introduction
This is a bot for [reddit](http://www.reddit.com), meant to automate straightforward moderation tasks by automatically performing actions based on defined conditions. For a large description of why this bot was created and what it does, [please see this post I made about it on reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheoryOfReddit/comments/onl2u/automoderator_a_bot_for_automating/).

If you'd like to utilize this functionality without running your own instance, just add AutoModerator as a mod to any subreddits you'd like to use it in, and [send a message to me (Deimorz on reddit)](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=Deimorz) explaining the conditions you'd like set up.

## Disclaimer

This code has been made public largely for the purpose of displaying exactly what AutoModerator does, and as an example for others working on reddit bots (moderation-related or otherwise). It may be difficult for others to get functional. Use at your own risk.
